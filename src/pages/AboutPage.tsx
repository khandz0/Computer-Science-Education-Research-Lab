                The Computer Science Education Research Lab at San Jos√© State
                University investigates how students learn to transfer
                programming knowledge across languages and contexts. We aim to
                design tools, learning experiences, and empirical studies that
                promote inclusive and effective computing education.

                Our work focuses on programming contextualization, bilingual
                programming, and the integration of AI/ML in computing
                education. We strive to support diverse learners by making
                programming more accessible and meaningful through
                language-aware technologies and culturally responsive
                instruction.

                  The Bilingual Programming Research Lab was established in 2023
                  through a founding grant from the National Science Foundation.
                  Our initial team of three faculty members and five graduate
                  students began exploring fundamental questions at the
                  intersection of natural language processing and programming
                  languages.

                  science. Our first major research project on "Natural Language
                  Code Synthesis for Novice Programmers" received recognition at

                  integrate natural language understanding with traditional
                  programming paradigms, while continuing to explore fundamental
