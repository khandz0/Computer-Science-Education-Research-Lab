                The Bilingual Programming Research Lab (BPRL) at San Jos√© State
                University is dedicated to revolutionizing how humans interact
                with programming languages. We believe that the future of
                programming lies at the intersection of natural language and
                formal programming languages.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Our mission is to develop innovative tools, techniques, and
                theories that make programming more accessible, intuitive, and
                powerful through bilingual approaches that leverage both natural
                language understanding and formal language semantics.

                Through interdisciplinary collaboration across computer science,
                linguistics, education, and human-computer interaction, we aim
                to break down barriers between human expression and computer
                execution.

                  The Bilingual Programming Research Lab was established in 2023
                  through a founding grant from the National Science Foundation.
                  Our initial team of three faculty members and five graduate
                  students began exploring fundamental questions at the
                  intersection of natural language processing and programming
                  languages.

                  The lab expanded to include collaborations with industry

                  science. Our first major research project on "Natural Language
                  Code Synthesis for Novice Programmers" received recognition at
                  international conferences.

                  Today, our lab has grown to include 15 researchers across

                  integrate natural language understanding with traditional
                  programming paradigms, while continuing to explore fundamental
