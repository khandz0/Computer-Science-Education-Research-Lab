Dave @ store #3081 provided great customer service. Been coming to this location for years.,positive

It's a warehouse of a dive. Too true the beer is cheap. Staffers were very laid back as were the customers I encountered.\n\nI've got to say not my cup of tea. I want more in the way of atmosphere.,negative
My family & i think this place is better than it was before. They are improving with every visit,negative
A friendly waitress with a smile gives it a second star. It's hard to be real in a airport... But at least pretend to serve warm wood.,negative

Worst pizza I've had it's insane how they managed to still stay open,negative
"Just wanted to give two thumbs up to McCarran for offering free wifi! I hope other airports will soon follow suit.\n\nBesides that, it's a nice, well-laid out airport. No complaints from me.",positive
Dump. Outdated and run down. However the staff is friendly. The restaurant is so so. And the free wifi is so slow it won't work. You can easily do better else where. Two stars for the staff only.,negative
Definitely not a gourmet las vegas buffet. Average at its best. If you have kids it is fine otherwise spend a few more dollars and go somehwhere else..,negative

Awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are 8 years old. Disappointing.,negative

Nothing special about our visit. They fixed a broken iPhone that had a bad screen. They were friendly.,positive

I got the breakfast burrito with salsa and they should have just poured water straight into it. Tasteless and gross. (I'm saying the salsa is waaaaaay to watery),negative

The wait is not worth the money saved! Do not reserve a car. Get to the airport and look at line before going with them.,negative

Their Old World Classic salad is the best! They make their own house dressing which is a creamy tomato italian that is great as a dressing or marinade.,positive

Skip the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. The cheesy flatbread is too dry and overpowers the sandwich.,negative
Such a great breakfast and lunch spot. I adore the Spanish omelette. Plus they will custom make your omelette to order. No worries about additions or changes. And tons of sides to choose from.,positive
What's their circulation? Where's their postal receipts? We are in their target market but no one has ever seen this magazine.,negative
Love this place. Great beer and great food. The location is awesome for before or after Badger games.,positive

"Awsome burgers, and the staff is really friendly. Managers moved our table because VIP wanted our table but the manager comped our next round of drinks.",positive

Absolute horrible service. If you want to me misled and ripped off go here. Save yourself the frustration of their terrible customer service and go elsewhere.,negative

Excellent service always at this location. Enjoyed a beautiful birthday dinner tonight with an amazing server. Great atmosphere. This is always by far my FAVORITE sushi place. EVER.,positive
Decent food if you're looking for something on the cheaper end (especially since everything else is so expensive). They're also open 24 hours so it's a nice option for late night hunger.,positive
Kinda trashy... But not quite. Good bargains on kids clothes. The cashier was sweet and friendly. That's about all I can really say.,negative

So disappointing. Both the one in Tucson and the one in Phoenix. Their prices appear to be RETAIL rather than RESELL. Way overpriced. There are better stores in town.,negative
Service as not good. The waiter was not attentive to the table because gratuity was included. The entrees took way to long to come out and do did the check and the connecting procedure ....,negative

Simply put: It is a touristy must-do.,negative
Just okay. My chicken katsu was overcooked and oily.,negative

"Had the saveur lamb burger, onion rings and a bloody Mary. It was delicious. The bloody Mary was very savory and tasty, definitely unlike any I have ever had.",positive
Fun dive bar. You got to get there early to snag a seat or be a hawk to get one. For being so inconspicuous and hidden they sure get busy. Good bar hopping place to hit up,positive
Food was okay. The place was empty. I felt bad because I hate seeing local places struggle!,negative
"Great fresh food, prepared right in front of you. Handmade tortillas are slung on a large circular griddle, just like your Mexican grandma used to make. The chicken tortilla soup is to die for!",positive
2 stars decent rolls but other than that very understaffed it took like 35 min for 3 rolls to come out!,negative
"I have to be honest - for ten bucks in Vegas, you have to hit the buffet. Decent meat and random sides are worth a bet at the blackjack table.",negative

"Not a bad little joint. Eclectic crowd and good food. The chicken fried steak on Thursday is worth the trip, but get there before 6 because they run out early.",positive

Great Friendly Neighborhood Coffee Shp,positive

"Aww sh*t,... food poisoning.",negative
"If you dine here, dine on the patio. The ambience is quaint and comfortable. The pizza is different, but in a good way. The brussel sprout pizza is the absolute shiz.",positive

Pretty friendly staff at this Subway and the food is served in convenient dine-in baskets. Definitely more appealing than the other stores around this area.,positive

SO GOOD.\n\nJUST GO.\n\nYou're welcome.,positive
Great thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients. Place was really hopping and service was awesome.,positive
I try not to go here unless I can help it. The employees like to point in a direction and tell you that whatever you are looking for is \'over there\'. Sad when I get better help at Wal-mart,negative
Wouldn't let my disabled friend in due to \'safety\' reasons . He was in a wheelchair. Could have sued,negative

Love this place...very intimate atmosphere.,positive
Not a great airport. It is chronically crowded and doesn't manage this well. I try to avoid this airport when possible.,negative
Came to this location late at night and was greeted by the friendly staff. Very affordable prices and good food! They even have a dollar menu! I would come back!,negative
Staff were very friendly and courteous. Food only so so. Taco shells tasted very old I did not eat mind (smelled like bad oil). Food temperature was warm could be hotter.,negative
Fresh bread with healthy selections :-),positive
food was just okay but our bartender/server Miguel was super. He was very attentive and he asked if our drinks were strong enough. He was willing give us extra liquor.,negative

First the food is good but the restaurant service is bad. Today is not busy and service still too slow and never come back to my table .,negative

Great price for great sandwiches. Two words ALL AMERICAN.,positive
Yum! I love the Turkey Burgers here!! The food is always great and service is incredible. Totally worth paying $12 for a turkey combo.,positive
Unreasonable price. Food quality is really BAD and has only very few kinds. You will definitely can have much better food with this price. They can survive by just bonding with tourist.,negative
Another delish outing at my favorite whole in the wall. Three pastys and two Liters of beer for under $50. Cheap and satisfying lunch for my work force!,positive
"Cappuccino in a bowl - my favorite! Best for brunch over looking the fountains. If it's not too cold outside, wait for outside seating. It's worth the wait!",positive

"Not terrible, but I probably won't be back. Food was so so. Drinks were inconsistent. Every margarita I had tasted different and none of them were quite right.",negative
Venue is normal for concerti venue. This has to be the most fucked up place to get a cocktail. That is the reason for 2 stars.,negative
GROSS!!!!!!,negative
Went once after this place just opened. Very disappointed. Over salty pasta and mediocre apps. Service was ok. Will not returned.,negative
Ordered delivery and it got here really fast. Within 15-20 minutes.\n\nGot the pork fried rice and it was pretty good. Generous portions and reasonable prices.,positive

"Review is for the frozen bar.\n\nOverpriced, even for Vegas. Not nearly as good as Fat Tuesday or Lime Ice.",negative
really bad and not worth the $$$ not authentic at all!!!,negative
The service was terrible and the help was outright rude. My best recommendation is to go someplace else.,negative
"The food tastes good but for $6.10 you'd think they'd give you more than half a spoon of rice and half a spoon of beans. It's just rice and beans, people.",negative
worst service I've ever encountered. food isn't bad but would never recommend this place due to the disorganized staff and the insanely long waits for everything.,negative
26$ hamburger was great after a night of partying. This one good thing about this place is that it is open to 5am.,negative
This is by far the best greek restaurant in town. I'm a vegetarian so I always get the spanakopita and greek salad.,positive

They never answered their phone.\nMaybe they're out of business?,negative

Not good. Threw away everything I bought. Blech. :-(,negative
My order is wrong 80% of the time. I think I will frequent the other coffee shops instead.,negative
Their lunch specials are always quick and delicious. Reasonable price for lunch and you can get your appetitie going with chips and salsa.,positive
Big disappointment. Was seated in a broken down area of the buffet section by hostess. Ceiling was peeling. Quality of food was not as expected. Very poor. Not worth it. No bang for your buck.,negative

Why have 1 day a week service and then on Saturdays. I guess I have to decide between ever going out of town versus getting trash picked up. Terrible idea.,negative

I ordered a Caesar Salad to go. Never have I a paid 9.00 for a worst salad. I was unaware the Greeks use brown old lettuce and Romaine,negative

This place is A dive. Really surprised this place is still here. red neck heaven. Don't recommend this to anyone. Restrooms are filthy. They don't serve food. Just beer. Liquor.,negative

better than most buffets in vegas. \n\nskip the dessert unless you really love sugar... like lots of them!,positive
The macaroons were not very good and definitely not worth the $28 for the small box. They were too spongy and lacked any depth or flavor. Bouchon has much better macaroons for the money.,negative

Wow super fast service with a smile! We had 8 in our group! My family wants one of these in Minnesota,positive
It's a simple gas station. I'm lazy if I can pay at the pump odds are I will. They have snacks & cold drinks. But me and my diet need not enter. So I just run in pay & go.,positive
Didn't know how to use the yelp coupon offer. Chips were old and cold. \'A\' team is not working tonight. Ill give it another try some other time.,negative

Hardly any selection on halloween make up. And I can't find an old granny long sleeve pjs... (Look for my ghost outfit for halloween). =(,negative
While the food isn't bad; it's just not worth the price. It calls to mind an Olive Garden or Red Lobster with a few more bells and whistles. 5 stars for great service.,negative

The variety is definitely there. The line was short for dinner. The food was pretty good. Overall not bad.,negative

"Good hotdogs and nothing much to say about this. If you are looking for a quick fix for hotdogs, then this one is just for that.",negative
Terribles isn't really that terrible. They have decent food at. Heap prices and they offer a few games with low limits. Drop by this place if you're near by.,negative

Really good food! And one if the few Chinese places where the staff smiles.. Good vibes ;),positive

"Love this place! Southern cuisine with a modern twist! Great food, friendly & professional service, and great atmosphere. My favorite dish is the pecan trusted trout.",positive
They serve beef tongue (lengua) and chivas (goat) need I say more! I love this place. They lose a star because from the taste and texture; I think they buy their chips instead of make them on site.,positive
Any Yelper that gave this place more than 3 stars must either work their or be friends with somebody that works there. TERRIBLE.,negative
"Nice facility but massage therapist tend to be below excellent at Massage Envys, for every good massage I must endure 4 - 5 well below excellent massages.",negative

"Food is what I'd expect from a diner, but the service is horrid. Price \\value good",negative

This place is incredible! Make sure to make reservations first though. And beware the food here is enough to feed four people. You must try the frozen hot chocolate. It's to die for!!!!,positive
eggs are whack and overwatery and hash browns like McDonald's \n\nI won't be back,negative

Must they over salt everything?,negative
Great buffet but be prepared to wait in a long line. Number three on the strip behind the Bellagio and Paris.,positive
Never buy tires here I have been through 6 defective ones and all were found by a third party to be out of balance every time. I will say the Manager was very helpful but it is still outrageous.,negative

"The service is always slow but the food is always good! Fresh, healthy, good portions.",positive

The music and ambiance amazing. Very professional crowd. Yet super guy heavy. View is super nice. Also in the other tower is mix similar view just different more casual layout.,negative

Mmmmm!! Yummy pizza - New York style!! Good spot near Fremont St! Good price And nice place to chill and break away,positive

"Love this place, I get the chicken tacos every time. Rice and beans are great, and the hot sauce is homemade.",positive
Went because a friend recommended it. Mediocre in my opinion. Panda Express meets Taco Bell. I had the red chicken and jerk fried rice. Beans are bad either one you get. Best part was snicker doodle.,negative
"Sushi was pretty good, but the fried chicken looked good. Yes. I said fried chicken.",negative
What a waste of my time! Very impersonal and uncaring. Made you feel like a $ not a person. I get better care doing my own PT at home. I wouldn't recommend the Charlotte OrthoCarolina to anyone.,negative

"Mediocre at best. Ordered in and food took an hour and a half to arrive. It was lukewarm. Miso soup was fine, but how do you screw that up?",negative
"Burger was dry, like could hardly get it chewed. Fries were rather good but my tater tots were mushy and bland. For the price, not up to par.",negative
"I like the birds. Everything else was all right. The board of meats and cheese was good. But for myself, it's not my go to place.",negative
Nicest casino in arizona. Lots of cowboy boots and rednecks. Nothing like Las Vegas or a real casino. :(,negative
Sat at bar for about 10 minutes and the bartender never even once looked in my direction to acknowledge me.,negative

Best sushi place in Vegas area. I drive all the way across town just to eat here. All other sushi restaurants are disappointing in comparison!,positive
Location is good. But the rooms are TINY and the beds are not that great. The best cheap hotel that I prefer is the Flamingo. Around the same price so I won't be staying here again.,negative
Got the house special drink and loved it!!!! Best boba drink hands down. Also tried the mango passion fruit & that was good too! Very nice lady!,positive
"Best pizza! My absolute favorite. This is a family owned place!! Wish there were more, but I will drive to surprise in a heartbeat for this pizza.",positive

"Great food, great bar, and a staff that recognizes and acknowledges locals/regulars. The happy hour menu is the great secret.",positive
Cant complain about anything here......Excellent is the word I would use to describe my experience. Try the hummus and the pickled vegis are a great addition.,positive
I wasn't impressed and had to wait 90 minutes to find out. The menu is limited and the food is decent but not worth the wait if you are looking for BYOB.,negative
We love this place!,positive

Stayed there with my parents in June. Clean and spacious rooms with a new/modern feel. Breakfast good.,positive

The restaurant is beautiful. The staff is super friendly. The food was ok. I ordered the mousaka entree and it was dry. The baklava was hard and all I could taste was cinnamon.,negative

Its nice to have firefly on my side of town. As I stated on my last review I wish they updated the menu making it exciting to see a few new options every once in a while.,positive
A good place to explore on a weekend. Many diverse offerings but often a little pricey.,negative

I can back up Kendra's statement about the menus as well. We had to wait ten minutes for a menu because there were non available.,negative

Nice change of pace from many of the other bars in the area. A fun rock bar with some scantily clad bartenders,positive
Cherry Lash Lounge is the best in town for sure!!,positive
It cheaper and is on the strip. Gambling is cheaper to from what you have to start off with. It has alot of people but rooms are smaller.,negative
"Great little place, lot's of games to play, cheap drinks. Needs more pool tables, or patrons who are willing to let other people play, and not hog the table.",negative

Nice corner market with a very friendly staff and their breakfast sandwiches are amazing,positive

Only done take out here. I have been impressed with the counter service and the food keeps us comeing back.,positive
The company I used was bought by them. Everything about Terminix is horrible. The only way to get them to stop charging my credit card was to let it expire. Horrible all around.,negative

"The most greedy person ever.. She doesn't keep what she says, she doesn't do ANYTHING to help you.. All she wants is your money",negative

"Good god, please order the fish tacos. Best I've ever had.",positive

Great chai lattes and friendly service!,positive
I've been there a couple of times. Last time I went it was worse than the first time. The food really didn't taste that good.,negative

Just spent $30 on a drink and the staff was rude and not helpful. They acted like we were bothering them. Go to fat Tuesdays this place is a total rip off,negative
"Les plats sont bons, mais sans plus. Compar\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres resto p\u00e9ruviens, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 quelque peu d\u00e9\u00e7u. Les nets semblent un peu fade.",negative

There wasn't a huge selection of foods like some of the other Vegas buffets such at the one at the Wynn. It's also a bit out of the way to get to. I definitely wouldn't go back.,negative

Pastrami is yum!,positive
"This place was so dirty, I couldn't wait to get out of there. The shampoo station was so gross. I won't be going back!",negative

An Irish pub that plays club music. Interesting. Fun enough!,negative

The food was creative yet lacked the fusion to make it wow!\nThe atmosphere needs \'something\',negative
the seating is weird. its a small room and they blow a lot of smoke. I felt like a total perv sitting there with my boyfriend. I dont know why the Rio is promoting this as heavy as they are.,negative
Bad Food. Bad Bad Food.,negative

"Big slice for $5. The pepperoni was good- lots of flavor, wide, flat slices. The crust was thin and crisp. I would've preferred more sauce but I enjoyed this pizza",positive

"Great place to go to especially on the weekends, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Line can be long, but if you know people, you can pretty much just get in before other people.",positive

Had a really good time here. The staff were friendly and the steak was good. Only thing stopping this from being a 5 is the slight conveyor belt feel of the large Las Vegas restaurants.,positive
The bar is very friendly and service was great. Free chips and salsa is a bonus too. Different types of salsa's to sample too. Wings were fair.,positive
"Yakitori is really good here, the miso is soso, and the rest looked good, but i don't like sushi..the staff is really nice and all in all a fun place.",negative
Typical fremont casino. Liked bennys bull pen and still want to try the steakhouse. My bf likes to gamble here.,positive
Worst zoo I've ever been too. Way over priced for a filthy facility. Will never waste my money here again. The only nice thing I can say is that all of the staff are very friendly,negative
"The worst company to deal with. Ordered $225 Valentine bouquet to be delivered\nThey never delivered . My loved one was devastated that I ignored her, not my fault theirs",negative
"I know I am from out of town, but there is no greeting at the door or system for new customers. It looks like a good place to eat and hang out, after you establish yourself.",negative
This place was amazing! And the selection was fantastic :),positive
"The salsa was okay. The fajitas, nothing to write home about. Overall, for a place that always has a long line....the food was not very good.",negative
Great food and atmosphere if you can get past then incredibly rude hostess. Their brunch is a better option than their dinner.,negative
I like running in here for a quickie lunch with their slice and drink special.,negative
Food was just ok. Service was unremarkable. Drinks were good. Food portions were very small. Rather pricey.,negative
"If you like racist waiters, inattentive servers, over cooked meat and limited options then this is the place for you. Worst Brazilian Steakhouse I've ever visited. But the salad bar was nice.",negative
"Awesome Hotel, Mediocre Casino.",positive
"Wanted to love it, but don't. Don't understand the hype. Didn't even finish my ribs. The definition of \'meh\' for me.",negative
"Does anyone know where Christine went? Or have her contact number? please let me know thanks!\n\nupdate: found her, if you are looking for Christine pm me.",positive
Tried the shrimp fried rice. I think it's safe to say I'm never going back.,negative
"Gro\u00dfe Auswahl an Cocktails in einer aparten Atmosph\u00e4re, die sich dezent von der Masse abhebt. Zu den Cocktails gibt es Gurkenwasser und ein bisschen Knabberzeug. Reservierung empfehlenswert.",positive
The most delicious freshes. Chinese food on the east side. Whenever I am in this area I already know what I am gonna eat :),positive
A Pittsburgh must-visit with good (not great) sandwiches in very generous portions. Family restaurant/sports bar range atmosphere.,negative
"Became our normal grocery store until we figured out where Trader Joe's was. Prices were never too high and they had special events from time to time, such as beer tastings.",positive
"I like this place for various reasons: its clean, its location(right on central). I love watching the light rail sitting on the patio. The food is great too.",positive
"Second visit Great patio but so many damn flies- and it's been like that for months- seriously need a fly trap- in my beer, food, all over the tables- disgusting.",negative
Chose 4 different tacos which had very different flavors and all were very good. I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in town.,positive
"Best hot chocolate ever, I highly recommend this place as the food is very good as well!",positive
"This is my SPOT! I come here for the Asada Fries, Taquitos or the Tacos..",positive
"good food, decent prices, fun atmosphere. it can be crowded! for pure sports event viewing, it would be better with all flat-screen HD sets, but you can't have everything I suppose.",negative
I am thankful every day for you and your team Michael Barnes! You guys are awesome and I will recommend you to anyone that will listen! :),positive
Completely lame.,negative
"+ good variety of sauces and wing styles\n+ Not the best wings in town, but pretty good overall. If you're in the Santa Fe and you're looking for something to eat, this is one of the better options.",negative
"The bread is awesome. Light on the meat, and the veggies weren't the freshest. Will go back only with a coupon as its costly for a sandwich.",positive
"Okay spot for lunch. The salads are pretty good. A little pricey for what you get. I wouldn't drive here to eat lunch, but if you work within walking distance it is a reasonable alternative.",negative
Food is ok...not great. The service is inconsistent at best. Management is nowhere in sight. There are better options in Charlotte.,negative
We didn't even get to eat! The hostess skipped over us and made us wait over an hour before we left.,negative
Great dumplings! Cheap too!,positive
Este restaurante lo unico que tiene de Guadalajara es el nombre. Todo es comida chicana muy malita. En el escusado habia un hombre semi desnudo aseandose...que asco. \n\nVerguenza ajena,negative
go here. good beer.,positive
It used to be good. But recently the quality plummeted badly. I don't wanna eat here again! Tasteless wings. Bad servers. Nothing is good about this place now!,negative
Good food. Decent price. The server could have been more attentive to our needs.,negative
I really had high hope for the Groupon for 2 for 1 gel or shellac manicure. Let's just say I won't be returning.,negative
"The best mexican food in casa grande. Really good prices. I've tried their nachos, carne asada burritos, and menudo, all are excellent. They have a nice salsa bar as well.",positive
I wanted to take my friend from overseas. This is interesting place to introduce. Portion? Oh yes it was too big to enjoy it but it is fun to take a picture. :),negative
Meh.. Edemame toooo salty. Ordered small asaragus roll.. Didn't show up. Entre was okay nothing spectacular. Prob won't be back.,negative
Okay coffee. But I think people only go here to see girls in lingerie make coffee! Haha but if that's what people like!,negative
Place is a cute little beer bar! Great beer selection too. Our server megan was really nice and helpful! We had the hummus and the pretzel pizzas and they were both really tasty!,positive
"Interesting crowd, good decor and Law and Order on the overhead TV on a Friday night?",negative
"So ingredients were pretty fresh for the salad. I wish the eggs weren't all crumpled (probably the wrong word) together. Overall for all you can eat and $7, it was pretty good.",negative
Sitting at new opening. Upsell attempts on even chips and guacamole.. lol. Menu somewhat limited. Tapas style.. Seems loaded with expensive tacos. Food was average. Had nachos and Baja fish.,negative
\'It will be a 25-35 minute wait\'. AN HOUR AND A 20 MINUTES LATER. . we got called but were already at the bar. Good food but they need to buy bigger restaurants..,negative
"I had a great experience here, Emanuel is a very good service advisor. Thank you Findlay for your great customer service!",positive
$600 for the 4 of us and I can't wait for the show to end so we could leave. Don't waste your money!!,negative
"Lady at the dressing room gave a lot of attitude, when i talk to my little sister about what she is allowed and not allowed to wear, input was un necessary, please.",negative
"Great shop, been coming here for years. I don't trust any other shop in Vegas. Definitely recommend making an appointment before you come.",positive
"Grab a coffee, and window shop. People watch. Sip. Enjoy.",negative
Michelle has been my waxer since 2006 I will not go to anyone else in Phoenix unless she decides to move. Love the atmosphere she creates for you! She is great!,positive
Cool tech to order on digital screen but far from the best gourmet burgers in town. If you want a good classic burger at a convenient location it's all right,negative
"It's an ok casino. However it is not on the strip, so it will be quieter. Generally will see more locals than tourists here. Always have seen friendly staff, and food has been good.",negative
Horrible service and food..and they ran out of beans and tortilla.and your a mexican restaurant.,negative
Limited dim sum selection. Slow and inattentive service. Skip it and go somewhere else.,negative
"Great food\nOnly one problem\nI don't like is that they put the silverware in a tin in the center of the tables. People cough, and talk over it which makes it not sanitary.",positive
Not a treasure at treasure island! Just\nNot impressed compared to other casinos. This review is based strictly on the casino. More of a smoke smell\nThan other casinos.,negative
This place is pretty cool. Love the decor and the staff is very friendly. I did get sick after eating here the first time. lol But I am willing to give it another try!,positive
"solid four and a half. Good food, great service. The crab was super fresh and I likes the offerings and desert. I would have this as my top seven buffets in Vegas!",positive
"Super yummy! The crust is thin enough to not make you feel like you ate too much. Everything looks fresh, and of quality. & it's very inexpensive. Definitely found our new pizza spot!!! Yay!",positive
"The food was pretty decent, but the waitresses were inattentive. No ambiance. Good green tea. They tried to commit our order to memory, which was a colossal failure. Both orders were slightly wrong.",negative
"Disgusting. I don't like it. A lot of crazy people, very dirty. Homeless people. We took bus here, it took more than 1 hour because of traffic. The big screen was nothing special.",negative
Quality workmanship at an affordable price. I was able to get my 2012 Jetta repaired and they even worked with me on getting the extra money i needed that my insurance didn't cover,positive
Service was mediocre food nothing to rave about only thing Bread was excellent,negative
"Seafood chowder was delicious... Lots of meat in it! Loved the steamed clams. Not crowded, will come again if in town :)",positive

"Our breakfast this past weekend, not so good. super crowded and order was not correct.",negative
"Dry chicken, bland help, yay it's southpark.",negative
"Loved the pulled pork sandwich!! This is a terrific family owned, neighborhood BBQ shop! I could eat there every day of the week!!",positive
The best grilled chicken and ribs in town. Favorite sides are the chicken pasta salad and steamed veggies. YUM!!!,positive
Pretty darn good overall. The garlic bread was AMAZING. The pasta was better than average. The decor was nice and comfortable. Looking forward to coming back soon.,positive
"RIG was awesome. Great live music, great crowd and my favorite Irish ale. What else can a guy ask for. Just a good ole party bar with the neighborhood crowd.",positive
"Bad service, even worse food. Everything looks dirty. Food was under cooked. Area is horrible and staff gossip all day next to your table due to tiny environment.",negative
Needs a remodel. Plain and simple. No 24hr coffee shop. You can stop with the \'we luv locals\' crap. The M shows a lot more \'luv\' in every way.,negative
"FANTASTIC! !! Wonderful family and they have great food TOO!!! Everything is amazing, you really can't go wrong, they even make tamales.",positive
Its just ok. They didn't return any of my phone calls. The people that work there are definitely not friendly. very small space. The teachers are very good.,negative
Worst service ever! brought the burger no fries...didn't care. Sent back the entire meal and no manager. waiter didnt even offer to bring me a new meal. Will go to McDonalds or In n Out next time.,negative
I absolutely love pho so 1. Delicious authentic Vietnamese food. The staff is great. I've been a customer for 7yrs.,positive
I'm not sure if I lived at the same place as these last two reviews. This place is tacky. Plan on being charged for carpet when you leave if you have pets.,negative
"Food is good enough to get my Mexican food fix, but forget it if your in a rush. They take forever to get you your food. I stopped going there because of that. Shame on them!",negative
Bad service at this location,negative
"Its just Ok. Very slow service. Pizza was not bad but nothing spectacular. I do not know what else to say. I was hungry, i ate some of their pizza, it was not too bad, i became unhungry. End of story.",negative
"I find the food to be tasty, but have noticed a significant decline in service and speed over the last several weeks. Too bad, will need to go elsewhere.",negative
Long long long lines and employees are helpful but dont seem very happy. It must be all the older people from sun city who I see fighting with them.,negative
Great place if you are craving french onion soup. Delicious chocolate souffle. The main course wasn't amazing but the soup and dessert is worth it once in a while.,negative
"Super-helpful sales people, great service, but can sometimes offer a limited selection. Great place to go if you can be flexible with what you're looking for!",positive
Amazing customer service. Very clean. Their buffet is good and is in the vegas top ten list of good buffets. Idk i just love this place,positive
Very quite! Not over crowded. Had a pleasant time with my two kiddos. Small fountain for the baby to play in was perfect.,positive
"Richard was our server, fantastic young man and a master of his craft. The food was delicious+. They deserve nothing short of 5 stars for both service and food preparation.",positive
"Save time,don't go, very rude and not very knowledgeable at all. Really don't know how their in business.",negative
"Food still good, until I used the NASTY mens room.. Barf. Cmon, I should have checked the restroom the first time I was here. Disgusting.",negative
"The chicken was dry and while it had flavor, I couldn't swallow it. \n\nNot worth the money. The commercial lied.",negative
"Very fast, painless, friendly, professional. What more could you want?! I'll be back soon!",positive
Hands down the nastiest nachos and guacamole dip I have ever had. What the hell is cheese sauce? $12 margaritas were weak. If we walked another 500 feet we would have found T&T in the Luxor.,negative
This place is horrible! They said if you want real eggs you have to ask them. Very confusing why the name is the good egg if they do not even serve real eggs.,negative
AMAZING sandwiches. I tried three different sandwiches and each one was more delicious than the last. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite in the area.,positive
Crap place that screwed up my rims on my brand new Jetta last year and would not take responsibility for it. Will not go back!,negative
this business is now closed,negative
Great Salon the staff was great along with the price! Recommend it everyone..,positive
There are so many other better breakfast places...,negative

the place where all you gotta have is a record to work there!!!sweet!!!,negative
Absolutly amazing!!!,positive
The food is amazing. Fish and chips and the roast beef (with mash potatoes) were insanely good. You MUST try the Yorkshire pudding!!!,positive
"Great place! Tickets include popcorn, pillow and blanket with waiters. Wow!",positive
"Couldn't make split pizza, prices way too high. The highest I ever seen on a pizza. $26 for a large is ridiculous. Athens pizza down the road was a lot better and cheaper and tasted better.",negative

"Convenient, fast, and a good cut.",negative
Unbelievable grilled cheese sandwiches!! The best you will ever experience. OMG,positive
"I ordered Pho Tai. It was perfect. They didn't skimp on the meat or noodles. It came out hot, the steak was still rare and perfect. The restaurant was nice and clean and the service was good too.",positive
Very expensive price to pay for a cup of burnt coffee. Decor along the usual hipster cafe vibe.,negative
This place was good probably my 3rd favorite ever. Really enjoyed the steak and appetizers,positive
"Service good, food OK and prices reasonable. On of the cheaper breakfast options in LV.",negative
Fav place in Charlotte--and that sweet potato ravioli... no joke changed my life. \n\nBest flavor for your buck in the city by far!,positive
"Quick tip: As a hotel guest, you can get free entry before around 11:30pm. Call the concierge to get on the list, and you'll wait in a separate, much shorter line.",negative
"great yellow curry and Thai tea here. think this the BEST chicken Satay I have ever had, but its made the traditional way so be prepared to wait awhile for it . well worth it",negative
I went to this store 3 times trying to purchase a necklace for my wife's birthday. Owner won't sell. Maybe because I'm not white ... she won't even hear out my offer. Will not be back.,negative
Here's why it's one star ... BALLY'S CLOSED IT DOWN.\n\nToo bad. I used to love this place. \n\nWhat the heck is going on at Bally's?,negative
I think Jay H. nailed it in her review. Great place to unwind and zone out for awhile.,positive
What took me so long to give it 5 stars?? Aiello's is now my go-to place for dates and visiting family. They're always wowed!,positive
Excellent tacos! Must try the tacos of Pibil! Very friendly service! Not your ordinary taco stand... Modern day taco bar!!,positive
The service was SLOW. I ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese. I found a piece of plastic inside the bagel. Yuck!,negative
Excellent food! Never had a bad meal or service here. I always get the take home classic pasta,positive
Very good old school country food. Prices are perfect and the staff is very friendly.,positive
"Broken sound system, dirty, $2 to get a wrist band for re-entry, dead crowd every time, BUT -- where else can local bands play?",negative
I can never turn away a good carne asada burrito. Their value meals are good and the portions are decent,positive
Not worth the time or your money !,negative
"Unbelievably Slow Service! \n \nPumpkin Martini was awesome but the food was mediocre. Wait - staff friendly but very, very S L O W and unattentive. Would not return.",negative
"Great good and service. Way better then Tacos El Gordo. The only problem is that they're way too far from my house, but worth the drive",positive
I called Moonlight Plumbing today and was very impressed. This wasn't the right company for my job however the technician was honest about their capabilities. I would use them in the future.,positive
"overcharged me on the bill \nthe food however, was pretty good but there are better places with just as good of food elsewhere in Vegas. No wonder the place is always empty.",negative
Had a large group and they accommodated us very well ... Great service and food !!! Horchata is a must try !!!,positive
Good chinese-korean food! I loved the noodles and spicy chicken. Worth a try for different type of food.,positive
"Everything was delicious, we ordered pad thai with chicken and yellow curry.",positive
....,negative
Loved the smoothies and the tea on my first visit here. Also appreciate that they have soy milk. I definitely plan on coming back!,positive
It's bar food. Who cares. The place is a lot of fun. I always walk out with a smile on my face. FANTASTIC Friday Happy Hour. 50\u00a2 beer and a free buffet of \'snack food.\',positive
"Excellent breakfast burritos for under $4! Great horchata too. That's all I had, but I'm giving them 5 stars for these 2 items.",positive
"I am addicted to their golden wings. Nothing compares. I have finally found the one and am blissfully in love. Game over. \n\nP.S. Never leave me, I will find you.",positive
"I like this place. It's a fun atmosphere, and the food is good. But, my favorite thing to get is the Caipirinha. I think you can also get a pitcher.",positive
"Snobby and pretentious. drinks are very weak. Too loud to hear anything. Floor is very slippery. Unfriendly doorman. not a fan, at all.\n\nJoes has a better dance floor. Firehaus has more class.",negative
Thats not BBQ...its meat with BBQ sauce :(((,negative
The food was so-so and the service was VERY slow. Need to figure it out if they are going to last here! Taco Tuesday ends at 4pm (kind of a bummer) but the 99 cent margaritas were fairly decent!,negative
Absolutely horrible experience. The service was better at Mc Donalds and the food was disgusting. Would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.,negative
Fried green tomatoes is excellent. Family feast from the menu is a must. Service needs some improvements though.,positive

The Peanut Butter cookies are to die for! The service is great and the place is clean! Win win! The brownie cookie was a little too hard for my taste but everything else's was delicious!,positive
"Went at 3am on a weeknight. Clean, quick, friendly and good food. I'll go back.",negative
The pharmacy guys were great. You can use the drive thru or stop on in. I noticed they had a phone ahead service also which I guess all the walgreens have.\n\nNot much more to say about a Walgreen's.,positive
Its like Sitting at the Airport. Cold ambiance. \nFood just Bad & expensive. I would go somewhere Else. I really regret it,negative
"Food is waaaaaay overpriced here. Simple breakfast, omlette, toast, misc items and dessert(oops).....$50.....sheesh.\n\nbtw, I did get THEbill and paid for with MYcash.....lol",negative
Amazing Thai food. Specialized spicy flavor depending on what you like. Great service AND they put on the NCAA tourney for us. Spicy wings were also straight fantastic.,positive
It's really kind of a just alright. One could tolerate a meal here but when going out the idea is not to tolerate but to really enjoy.\n\nBoth me and my partner felt the food was kind of bland.,negative
"First time here, won't be the last. Great service, great food. I'm so full yet so happy.",positive
Second best dim sum I've had in Vegas :) their beef noodle is second to none. And their chicken stir fry as well as won ton soup is da bestest!,positive
Wrong place. my review is regarding Siena Hills Primary Care.,negative
I'm guessing they change the owners this place is not good as it used to be. It's a rip off.,negative
this store has a lot of gourmet items in it compared to the one I usually go to and they have a Starbucks inside. \nThe store was very clean and well stocked. The workers were nice as well,positive
Service was terrible and staff was very unfriendly!,negative
Turkey panini was good but they served my coworker a chicken panini that was raw in the end. Service was ok. Wish they would've checked it better. That could be dangerous.,negative

"Come early! I love all Harkins Theaters, this one is one of the busiest!",positive
"Salsa club moved next door, but restaurant closed on 08/15/2009. I always wanted to try this place, I'm sad to see it go....",positive
Overpriced veggie. Not fulfilling. food was meh!,negative

"AWSOME place for breakfast. They said they were slow, but I didn't find them to be such.\n\nVery friendly staff. VERY eclectic tunes!",positive

"So happy this location is here!! I love coming in on Sundays and getting their lox and bagel. Great tasting coffee, too!",negative
We did the 90 minute tour and had a great and knowledgable tour guide. It was great to actually sit in his chairs and walk through many of his buildings! Well worth the money!,positive
This is a decent place to get drinks. I've never tried the food so I can't comment on that. The patio is also nice.,negative
Lola's on Central is now Citizen Coffee- Not the same.... But still a local coffee shop that beats out your local 'Bucks. I recommend making the trek to Lola's on Roosevelt.,negative
the house spaghetti was so so bad. i would have paid $6 for it. it was plain and i can't believe that is their house specialty.\n\nthe foie gras ravioli was good. \n\nservice was not so great.,negative

Open real late! delicious sandwiches!,positive

Food is Ok but service is very bad.. They do not even give water glass to customer and we have to buy it. I would never go there again.,negative

Look good to me Burger Bar will look,positive
Went here to see memorabilias and to visit the Rock Shop.....they've got cool Hard Rock gear - I ended up shopping for my Christmas list here.,negative

"Grilled cheese was great, but the Hungarian Ghoulash is not to be missed!",positive

We eat here at least once a week. The service is awesome and the food is always good.,positive
Spaghetti sauce tasted like chef boyardee and $18 for 5 ravioli. Then we went for an actual dinner afterward.,negative

Lunch buffet was fabulous! A good number and variety of dishes to choose from. Friendly and attentive staff as well. Must try if you like Indian.,positive
As delicious as it looked. Would have submitted a photo but we ate it all too fast. Breakfast simply taken to the next level! This could compete with any of the big name chefs on the strip.,positive
My order was wrong three times yes three times!!! Never be back walk out not happy and never be back !!,negative
Loved the seafood buffet on Sunday. The food was always stocked and tasted amazing. So many choices. Nancy at the bar and Jeff at the carving station were wonderful. Will be coming back again!,positive

Gotta agree with Ebony. I can' t go in here without finding a bunch of stuff at great prices. I go in for one thing and come out with some fantastic deals. They have kind of replaced Mervyn's for me.,positive
Essence had great service and a friendly staff. The food was average and the setting could use a major uplift. The place seemed a little old and dingy for a bakery with some potential.,negative

"Not stoked at all especially after the build up. Didn't get pizza. Actually turned my bolognese dish back. Overall, not happy with the entire experience.",negative
"Grilled veggie appetizer, not so much soggy drenched in oil as far from grilled as you can get. No flavor at all not even a pinch of salt. Pizza not great, overloaded with basil but a good crust",negative
"Great steaks and sides. Traditional steakhouse, very good service. Worth the trip.",positive
Very good salsa. Cops from fresh tortillas. Food was tasty. Service was friendly. Prices very reasonable. Not much of a wine selection but hey what do you expect.,positive

We ate lunch here. It was okay. Nothing really special. Service was good. Nice/clean environment.,negative
The band is horrible. They take \n\'requests\' but know very few songs. This band is just some super cheesey pricks. The clog dancing woman was cool though. Avoid these horrible musicians though,negative

Good gas prices & staff is friendly but very very very dirty! Half the coffee pots were empty & the got coco was not working. I was left getting tea & that skieved me out. GROSS!!!,negative

Anything with El Pastor (super flavorful pork) is crazy good here! Open 24 hours is a major plus! Service is great even at 3am. I do find my self adding salt to anything with asada here,positive
The food is good but you need to demand your bills. breakdown of orders are somewhat vague. We just felt we are somewhat overcharged. I'm so hesitant to visit this restaurant even though it's near us.,negative
The griddle is the best. French toast and waffles are great. I have tried most everything on the menu and loved it all.,positive
Great food ... But there were 3 issues\n1. You can not creat your own omelet \n2. Slow services \n3. Little bit pricy,positive
The only good thing were the fries. I had the chopped salad and it was gross. The service was bad too. Took 30 minutes to get our check after it was clear that our plates were somewhat done.,negative

Items ordered:\n\nPho tai: tasty\n\nThe regret: 3 buns for $10\n- braised pork was so tiny and all fat\n- they will push that item on you. STAY AWAY!,negative
Still great. I forget how good they are and wonder why it goes so long between visits. \n\nService was slow and forgetful but once you eat you forget about it.,positive

Sherry is amazing!!! She delivered our son yesterday and everything was PERFECT!!! We couldn't be happier!!! Thank you Sherry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Wonderful restaurant. I have eaten my birthday meal here for the last 3 years. The falafel is outstanding. The couple who own and operate the restaurant are genuinely friendly and kind.,positive
Similar to feativals in other parts of the country but better weather. Purchasing directly from artist or artisan gives more meaning. Some artists look like their work.,positive
"So we walk in and they have a rap battle on the stripper stage. The people paying more attention to the rapper than then actual strippers, that gives us opportunity with the girls and I love it ;)",negative

Great corner location and patio. Nice cold beer but average food. The short rib sliders and pretzel appetizers were just so-so.,negative

Come on. It's greasy fast food.,negative

There is no doubt this is the best pizza place in Montreal.,positive
The KimChee bowl...please take off menu. As a half Korean I was sorely disappointed...and the shrimp \'etouffe\' was no where close. I dropped $80 here and expected much more.,negative

ordered sliders... the inside was purple. the Caesar salad was nothing to write home about. but the pretzel sticks were yummy.,negative
The thought that went into the menu and cocktail offerings alone would rank this restaurant a five stars. But add an attentive and knowledgeable staff and you have an unforgettable dining experience.,positive

"I've never eaten there, so I can't address that. I only can address the quality of the pizza.\nI'm usually only a fan of thick-crust pizza, but for thin crust, this is excellent.",positive
BEAUTIFUL! STUNNING! \nGood drinks. Good everything!\nSO PRETTY!!! Really amazing!,positive
"Amazing atmosphere. Terrific service and drinks. The food is good but not out of this world, thats the only reason its not a 5 star. Great place to take somebody you want to impress.",positive
Sad attempt to bring back a once cool place.. Boo- the games are so over priced and it's the same games $108.00 rip off. We need a Dave and Busters...,negative
I really appreciate the food ere. It is quality. I come from the east valley and hasn't found decent Chinese food on the west valley till this restaurant arrived.,positive
The Double Double is just the Best Best burger in the universe.,positive
Favorite part of the meal - hush puppies and sweet tea! I think i can just eat that for dinner.,positive
"This place has gotten progressively worse since we came here years ago. Nachos were huge, but tasteless. The margaritas are a joke. I make better ones at home!",negative
Good food but odd that they lost my lunch order. Thanks to those manning the counter who realized I was waiting and filled the order on the spot.,negative

"Hip atmosphere, eclectic mix of food. I had the cubanini and it was satisfying. I want to try the sushi next time.",positive
I find La Tasca to be tapas my numbers - not particularly inspirational. The one at the Omni Centre is better than the one on Charlotte Square.,negative
"Nice park with lots of things to do. Batting cages, indoor wave pool. Nice place to take my grandson to play. They recently added some new things to climb and jump on.",negative
Love this place for lunch! Fun Italian atmosphere with great food and service. If you work around the Valley View/Russell area I would suggest going there for a panini.,positive

They made a small mistake on our order for which they went above and beyond to fix it. It was more than necessary and unexpected. The Kung pow chicken is great!,positive
always nice to be there for a quick warm-up drink,negative
Gold Coast Bowling Alley Bar til 3am . $2 shots . $3 well drinks . $1 bowling after midnight per game . Nice bartenders & a fun time .,positive

"Not sure, I would really count this as a review, but more of a simple FYI. If your thinking of heading here don't. This place has closed. :(",negative
This place is great. Cheap rooms. Great location. Join the players club and they always send you free room offers. IMHO the best place to stay in Vegas for the money.,positive
My checkout attendent Danielle was rude & unhelpful. The engraving machine is cool though.,negative
These guys disappeared and we never saw our money. :\\,negative
SO MUCH PRODUCT! The store is huge! \n\nI was able to find the 'sellout' Urban Decay shadow that doesn't seem to be in stock in any of the Michigan stores (#WIN) \n\nThat's all it takes for me!,positive
Great value and menu and delicious!,positive
it was right downstairs from moon.. it was allright.. mainly tables for gambling.. not much of a dancefloor or a club..\n\n\n\nwould recommend this place to people who want to chill at a nice venue,negative

If your hungry in the A.M. This is the place. Their breakfast burritos are great. Enjoy.,positive
This place is CLOSED on Sunday October 20. The phone number (both on Yelp and in the door ) isn't working and the inside looks empty.,negative
Fantastic service with a quality product. What I've been looking for in a ice company for years. I'm glad to have finally found it.,positive
Very polite but extremely SLOW!!!!! The slogan is\'freaky fast\' but that is definitely not the case at this location.,negative
"Delish, but they don't speak English. It doesn't look clean. It's quite strange. It's really really good food though. Sometimes I don't even get what I ask for. It's strange, but good.",positive
Went there to purchase outdoor furniture . Salesperson Brandon could not have been more helpful. When I need something for my fireplace I know where I will be going to.,positive
Seafood Pan Roast!,positive
"Soccer, tennis, and basketball facilities. Kids playground. Good walking for dogs and their owners.",positive

Came here with the conference people...not a bad place in the heart of the gay village. Bit warm upstairs.,negative
"One of the best meals I've had in Vegas. The food was great, service was good, and the view was AMAZING. Great place to bring a date.",positive
Food was good when it finally came. Portions were small. They had no staff working. Waited 20 minutes to place drink order. Probably will not go back.,negative
Worst place ever for alterations. They ruined 4 shirts and two pairs of pants. They took out to material and didn't leave enough room for future changes. \n\nStay away!!!!!,negative
"I used to love Chompies no more. I got served yet another overly fatty, overly salty corned beef sandwich that was nothing but a mound of crumbly fatty meat. Where is Robert Irvine when u need him?",negative

Always close out sales...\nEquipped with basic sports needs...\nGreat offseason deals!,negative
Decent sushi but small portions. Good variety of rolls. Hole in the wall. I would return.,negative

love this place! We had the same waiter both times and Ian was awesome! Food is really good too! Will be back again. Especially like the beer samples so we know what to choose :-),positive
Awful. Took over an hour to check in. Then had to wait 30 min for my luggage. They said they switched to a new computer system but this is unaccetable. I will not return.,negative
"I am a pho fan and theirs is more than fair! Flavorful spring rolls with peanut sauce, tender orange chicken, and a delicious house-made coconut water!\nGo and enjoy!",positive
Could not find location. Maybe closed? Or wrong address...,negative
Grouchy johns not only has amazing coffee but also has some of the best service in Vegas. They make you feel at home while you sip on some amazing caffeinated goodness.,positive
Fun locals bar. Had good drinks and entertained by the crowd. Came here when they had a bunch of old school cars out front and the owners didnt mind u checking out their cars.,positive
Friendly staff I must say but drive thru is a pain in the morning. Better off going inside. A lot faster,negative
horrible. Just horrible,negative
Was ok until now has this terrible experience\n\nNo,negative

Quality ingredients and good flavor. Its decent takeout.,negative
"We went in on a $2.00 Tuesday's. Everything was sticky, and the food was sub par. The cheese curds were our favorites - and we ordered some slices. So cheep diner food, with the sports theme going.",negative

"Fantastic food at very fair prices, and they have the most AMAZING service. I could repeat what the other reviewers are saying, but will post some photos instead. :-)",positive
I had brunch here and it was OK. The portion was a descent size and the taste was fine. I think it was a little salty for me which means for a normal person veryyyy salty.,negative
Nice place waste time in. Nice place to get a good friend a gift. Coffee in the back is good. They have specials on Wednesdays on the coffee. They also have wine and beer tastings once in a while.,negative
"Okay, but there are better seafood joints in town. Would not go out of my way for it!",positive
I guess the saying 'you get what you pay for' is true for this particular buffet. I've experienced much better. I won't ever come back because there are much better buffets around the strip. Sorry.,negative
"They make a decent pie. Interesting combinations instead of the usual fare. The price, I think, is about $5 too high for what you get, but it is fairly tasty.",negative
"Fantastic variety of scrumptious crepes and warm friendly service. Reminiscent of cafes in Europe. Sometimes there is a small wait for your order, but it's not fast food (nor do we want that)!",positive

"GONE!\n\nNo longer in this cute House - In its place, a new Business: Savannah's : Dining, Bakery & Catering.",negative
Cafe Myriade is a small unassuming cafe but they serve a nice selection of coffee and Black Cat espresso. Nice selection of pastries as well. The smaller setting is welcoming.,negative
"Grilled calamari was excellent. I took 4 choice of meat, with fries. The house sauce was great too! I would definitely go back.",positive
It's quite easy to make something hot. The trick is to make it flavorful and hot. Los Dos Molinos only knows hot. They have no idea about flavor. End of story.,negative
"Fast service, lentil and spicy italian sausage soup was yummy. Main course was Salmon , scallops and shrimp \'The Damian\', sauces were great not heavy and seafood cooked just right .",positive
hi this is my first review im on the search if something original and fresh and this i not is why i tough.... below expectations food is not great is average..,negative

I've been using PreFlight for all my business trips...I've used others but PreFlight has been the most consistent and reliable. I would highly recommend these guys for off site airport parking.,positive

"Speechless. Unlike other Vegas hotels who tend to imitate european architecture, they have the most unique and exceptional designs. Check out the waterfall fountain and beautiful garden.",positive
"Vast variety of beauty and hair supplies. For ethnic, hair professionals and woman across the board. Reasonable, clean, friendly staff. But NO REFUNDS!",negative
Not the illest nails at all. Massage chair was broken. They had no artistic ability for nail designs. And the pedicure was lazy not even a massage with it. Won't be going back.,negative

Damn good Dim Sum. \n\nReason enough to give strip mall chinese restaurants an honest shake.\nFinally another Chinese restaurant in the valley worth patronizing.,positive
"Great hospitality, I went last week with my touring college prep program. The food was great I ate a bacon cheese burger with collard greens and seasoned grilled corn.",positive
"ehh, I've had better. Okey environment, especially during happy hour but there are a few other places nearby that I think strive to achieve more.",negative
The food was so bad. The meat quality was horrible and hardly edible. There are much better Chinese food places to try.,negative
"Stopped here along the way home. Woo, road trips! Great customer service and great subs! I'd recommend this place to others",positive
"good food, good drinks, good location, good view. good music! Convenient location in the middle of the Strip. Wait for a table on the 3rd floor deck - the view of the Strip is worth it.",negative

Food was good. Service was mixed. Wierd interaction with a bartender who said the place had nothing to do with San Francisco. All the marketing in the hotel seemed to lend itself that way.,negative
It's disgusting. Should be called the International House of Poop. The one's in Philly are better.,negative
Loved the environment! Food was excellent. Just the right portion! Salsas were amazing.,positive

Stop by every now and then to grab a smoothie. They are very good. I'm a big smoothie fan. Also like their wraps and sandwiches. Best smoothie the acai smoothie.,negative
Overpriced and their brisket was below average at best. Midwood Smokehouse is far better and better priced.,negative
They suck!! Go for a smog they tell me there's 6 people ahead of me and it will be an hour and a half wait. That's way too long when a smog is only about 3 minutes.,negative

a really good variety of stores and restaurants but the parking is pretty much a nightmare its ok if you can find a central place to park and just do a walk around as long its not too hot,positive
"Pretty good place to have drink. The food is pretty good also. Sometimes the bands in specific the \'singers\' they hire are uhhh, not always on key, to put it nicely.... But it's still fun!! :)",negative

I went here again and tried the Chicken Caprese Sandwich. It was great! Make sure you have the bread toasted or it will get gummy as you eat it. I love this place!,positive
Great Thai Food and Cheap. My only complaint is that they have weird hours and their parking lot is a bit sketch at night.,positive
There is may be one or 2 nice people there. ;( Getrting my 16 year old his DL was DEFINITELY a memorable experience in this joint!!!,negative
Bros.,negative
Warm friendly family owned restaurant. Food is very fresh and good. I would definitely go back and eat. Very authentic. Yummy!!,positive
"Food was great, pre- dinner bread and sauce was fantastic. I ordered the baked meat ravioli is was very flavorful and lots of cheese on top, just the way I like",positive
I've been going here for years and always pleased with everything. The fact that this place has been in business for as many years as it has speaks volumes that they are doing it right.,positive
They have some awesome sales people. Unfortunately because of my very negative experience with another autonation dealership I had to walk away.,negative
My nail technician took such a huge chunk of skin off my toe when she was cutting my cuticle it still throbs! And that was 2 months ago. Do not go here this place is bad!,negative
Delicious. This high-end sushi bar in a wealthy area is some of the freshest around. Fancy marble bar with plasma TV. Friendly service and nice atmosphere make this a very enjoyable experience.,positive
Good food. Cheap,negative
Complete rip off. Paid $110 for 2 to eat a dinner that seemed like it was cooked at Denny's. \n\nDo not go here,negative
Map wrong its not in uptown,negative
Super bummed. The original owners of this location sold it. Not as good as it originally was...won't be going back.,negative
The cupcakes here are good (not great) they are pretty and presentable but in a sense plastic. They genuinely lack the decadence for the price you pay. Good for kids events.,negative
Not impressed had the calzone and it was burnt to a crisp on outside all fillings cold on inside. Just go to food court you will have better food lol,negative
"If I could give this place a zero I would. The repairs which I had done, turned into more repairs which were preventable. Please\nSave yourself some money and take your business elsewhere.",negative

We are from the south and know great barbecue. This barely passes.,negative
Deli fried chicken is decent (when you are starving) and a good deal. This is pretty much your basic Safeway.,negative
"Worst cab company I have been in, in a long time ~ like ever. Long hauled. $10 trip ended up being $30. Will complain to Nevada Cab Authority.",negative
Don't make your customers walk to the back of the store to get your own brand of water! Fry's in Phoenix puts plenty of water cases in the front of the store! It's a DESERT!!,negative
"They always screw up the order, especially on take out!",negative
Love how you can get your favorite flavors in different sizes for a good price. When my family & I crave we buy quarts & keep them in our freezer. Circus animal cookie is my favorite!,positive
"It's just a nice, well-lit neighborhood grocer with friendly employees. I'm not sure why there's hate for the place. I had no problems with it.",positive
"Horrible , overpriced food",negative

"A lifeless husk of the original Fleur de Lis. We weren't particularly fond of anything served, and with service you would expect at Applebee's.",negative
"Nice red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing, but all the cupcakes had too much icing - sugar and fat overdose!! The guava and cheese pastry wasn't great.",negative
Good menu and great beers on tap. Get there early or expect to wait for an hour minimum.,positive

It alright not much but it foods. Good beer but it needs to be chilled not cold.,negative

All the flights are delayed aaaaaaaaaa,negative
Amazing food.\nBig Portions\nGreat service,positive
"A single star? You bet and that's only because these folks have something at at least resembles bagels, and they're overpriced at that. Go to the Bagel Cafe, which has real ones.",negative
Horrible! Service sucked. Had to ask hostess to get a waiter. Messed order up and 3 people got served before 4 order was put in. Worst food ever!,negative
Fast & efficient service. Employees are very amiable and prices are reasonable. A great quick pick up especially if you're waiting for jury duty!,positive

"Nick took care of me tonight, I didn't even know if this location and good to know now. Great atmosphere, and quality barbers.",positive

"Smokey, inattentive staff with poor restaruants. \nThe movie theater, and the starbucks are the only thing that is saving this place for me...",negative
They told me 45 minutes to a hour They took 2 hrs and food was ok. Nothing special. I would not eat there again,negative
"The owner made my spicy Italian sub, delicious! And \'he did build his business\' too! Without Obamas help",positive
Decent BBQ. Ask for the super hot BBQ sauce since it isn't on the table. The smoke wings are great but I found most of the sauces too sweet. Price is on par for BBQ.,negative
I love this place for a quick teriyaki. I disagree w/ others who say its expensive I think it was right on track...Combo meat veggie bowl is my fav and their spring rolls are GREAT~,positive
"Cheap drinks, great bartenders,friendly people, bands at night. Great neighborhood crowd. Everything u want!!!",positive
"Excellent very flavorful, great service you can really tell they put pride into their food could tell that the meat was marinated and tortillas were homemade. I will be back for sure!",positive

"recommend: grilled salmon+bean sprouts, coconut sauce chicken rice. very hot and fresh served. mango salad was average. enjoyed it .",positive
"great food, the butternut squash ravioli was excellent! It's BYOB which is great, but it's on the small side, so expect a long wait on peak hours",positive
Asked for spicy Teryaki chicken and receive a pile of burnt red peppers on top. Whole dish tasted like burnt food. Bummer. Owners seemed nice.,negative
$50 for 3 burgers and a shake. Are you kidding me!!! Shake was not real. Very disappointing when most Ruby's are pretty good.,negative
"This place is the new Chop & Wok. Good old fashioned, down and dirty chinese take out. The owner is right out of a Seinfeld episode and it's worth eating there just to watch him run the show.",negative
"I have been in Arizona for almost 17yrs now and up until a few months ago, Macayos was my favorite Mexican restaurant. Cien Agave is soooo good! Thats all I can really say!",positive
CLOSED. \n\nThey recently had their closeout sale and are now closed. :(,negative
Always clean and friendly attendant . Lady is actually working and not away from her responsibilities like at other places.,positive
Good location but seriously how much would it cost to put cushions in the armrests...,negative

This place was ok. There is no crab legs/Shrimps in the buffet at all.\nIt was over price for what they served...,negative
Very overrated. Our food was cold and my vegetarian dish was awful. Overall a bad experience.,negative
Bar wasn't busy and service wasn't great. \nI don't even remember the food that I ate.\n\nBeer was half-assed Belgium and also overpriced\nbut I must admit that the Mystery beer was nice.,negative

"So sad to see you go.\n\n$1 Blackjack, 4oz martinis,blood on the walls and semen on the sheets.\n\nYou were my kind of place.",positive
I stopped by to pick up some of their exclusive and famous Big Willies Vanilla Custard. Only place that carries it. It's a must try/buy.,positive
Had a very disappointing breakfast. The french toast actually comes with toast. Really? The French toast and bacon came out cold. This is more of a coffee place is a breakfast place.,negative

Bad customer service. Unreliable.,negative
"Bon \u00e9clairage, bonne ambiance, mais assez bruyant! Le service laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer la nourriture est tr\u00e8s moyenne et le prix est tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour ce que c'est.",negative

Fun friendly place. The food is ok & better than other Mexican places in the same area.,negative
"I've eaten here a couple times, once for breakfast and once for dinner. The food is good but overpriced for the amount you get. The employees were nice and the service was fast.",negative

"Worst Chinese Dining ever, and on my Birthday too, customer service is rude & my appetizer was the last dish to get into the table... 1st and Last time here",negative
"Awesome food, I would rate the taste of food as better than Thai basil. Staffs over weekend are not friendly. And I don't prefer this place for A-la-carte but best for the weekday lunch combos.",negative
Would not honor vendors 25% off discount sign and very rude and condescending . With this kind of service they wont last long.,negative
Great place for good food and good people. Beer on tap is great.,positive

yech! i don't want to waste my time even writing about it....it brings back bad memories and a bad taste in my mouth. don't say i didn't warn you :-p,negative
Cheapest place to get a sea doo. The owners were awesome and more than helpful!!!! Best rentals in henderson!!!,positive
"Burgers rock! Seating sucks, rays of sunshine from the setting Sun will bore holes into your face. Get the BBq bacon cheddar burger, it's a real panty dropper",positive

Local watering hole. Very friendly.atmosphere. Angie the bartender was very nice and helpful. Regular good bar food... Exactly what you.would expect from this local joint,positive

We ordered a tres leches cake for my daughters birthday party and we were disappointed. It looked pretty but it was too soggy. We won't order that kind of cake again.,negative
The bartender screaming the f-word was an instant turn-off. Rowdy crowd.,negative
The Chuck Box has fresh and delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches. They grill your food right in front of you and they have a great condiment bar so you can get just the right amount of toppings.,positive

no internet. too far from strip. not a great room. unfriendly staffs.,negative
They may accept pets but also accept smokers--the room smelled like a smoldering pile of feces laced vomit. This place is disgusting--no black light needed to illuminate the extent of filth.,negative
Best coffee in Phoenix! We come here 3-5x's each week. They really know how to make a great latte. Thanks!,positive
the \'combination with choice of 2 meats\' is actually putting 2 meats in 1 sandwich. I like their potato latkas though.,negative
lots of fun,positive
Food - First rate; especially the dim sum\nService - OK\nHas the look and feel of a 1950s Vegas casino restaurant,negative
"Love watching the \'dance\' of making the drinks. Super fast service, huge selection.\nKeep wanting to branch out but end up getting the Tiramisu again and again.",positive
Place has some cool vibes at the pool. Somewhat hip crowd. But the hotel itself is nothing special and way overpriced.,negative

I come here every year for my birthday. You can't go wrong with the breakfast menu. The only downside about this place is that it's far from my house.,positive
Great taxidermy. Awesome year round christmas decor. Cheap drinks. Even a free ping pong table. What's not to like?,positive

"enjoyed their frozen hot chocolate, not their service.",negative

First time and first rate breakfast and service. Prosciutto chunks with goat cheese and spinach in a frittata was inspired. Shared cinnamon French toast and waddled out. We'll be back it's a keeper,positive

Excellent service with friendly staff. Very reasonable prices and they have drinks and snacks in the lobby while you wait. I recommend this place to all of my friends!,positive
A great place to go after a workout. The smoothies and bowls are pretty yummy. I'm a sucker for their pancakes. It can be pricey but it's pretty typical for a healthy joint.,positive

"Really Great cocktails though can be a bit pricy. I always feel that the bar is quite small and dark, which is such a shame. Service at busy times is a bit slow too.",negative

Choose the Chief Choice!,positive

over priced and barely average food. wouldnt return,negative
You suck Holsteins! You have kids meal sizes and food is not really worth the price. I can go to McDonald's and get better milkshakes. I shall not be back.,negative
I don't get it... Why review the capitol? Would anyone consult YELP in making a decision to visit?,negative
Why did I not read today's reviews before going here,negative
Very good food. I always go there for pho. Their curry is also not nad. My & my friend often get the three colour bean drink.,negative

"All I can say is -- get rid of the salt! Wow, food was just okay but the salt level was overboard.",negative
Booked my hotel on Priceline.com for $50. Hotel is dated but for the price I can't complain.,negative
Check out is ridiculous!!!! Nice rooms and techy gadgets but check out in room doesn't even work and then when you get to the lobby...crazy long line.,negative

"Only because I know the food is good that I give it 2 stars, but otherwise the service is absolutely horrendous. I won't be coming back, cause the food isn't good enough to excuse the poor service",negative
Authentic & formal dining but not strict dress code. Aloo gobi was great & very hot. Great waitstaff.,positive

Worst ever I was waiting for about 30 minutes and about 10 people got their nails done before me and I was there first. My nails were painted horrible never go here!!!,negative
Over-priced weak mall pizza,negative

"Happy hour here is a must. Try the wings and sweet potato fries. AND, beers (GOOD beers) are $3.",positive
Love this place.. 2nd only behind The Palazzo..,positive
"Possibly the worst poutine and cheeseburger. Fries were cardboard, cheese was rubber. Cheeseburger was okay, but will not be visiting again. Avoid!!!",negative
"Good food. Sushi is my all time favorite food, so I'm a tough critic. Wasn't the best I've ever eaten, but it was good. I'd recommend and eat there again.",negative
Lots of yogurt flavors and mix-ins. Seems a bit expensive. Worth a visit if you like to customize your dessert!,negative
worst compay ever. rude drivers and even more rude dispatch. Barry in dispatch needs some people skills training.. take your business elswhere,negative
Normally only one restaurant in each city will serve xao long bao (soup inside) dumpling. This is the one. Amazing!,positive
I've had better BBQ from Famous Dave's. I don't recommend and would suggest driving the extra distance to go somewhere else.,negative

I was disappointed in my breakfast. The coffee was terrible. The eggs were average. And the service was well below average. Not a place I would go back to.,negative
"Way too expensive for a burger that was good, but I've had better. For 15.00 they could've thrown in some fries at least. Service was great though and atmosphere was nice.",negative

"As of March, 2011 this place is out of business. Sad I didn't go more when I had the chance. Food was great.",negative

I've never set foot into the Anvil or even back in its Mason Jar days but; a friend of mine in Tucson has some good memories of the (late) CellBlock down E Indian School.,negative
Really rude on the phone. Hope she's nicer to the pets.,negative

"Great locally owned bakery! Fresh donuts, bagels, pastries, and cupcakes. Consistent quality and selection. \n\nThey'll even custom fill and frost/coat your donut!",positive
The games in the back add a lil something chill. And feeling like ur not out the club trying to have a smoke is chill.,negative
Worst wait ever. Longer wait than a doctor's office just to return some equipment. This store needs to hire more people.,negative
For people who love fast food service yet upscale food. A Kneaders dessert is a treat you must try. Do your taste buds a favor.,positive

Shrimp Cocktail was dissapointing for sure,negative
Bad food and expensive beer. The fries were way too salty and pretzels were super greasy. Won't come back.,negative
Was told at 5am that burgers arent made until 4pm by some chubby ogre latina.\n\nStay in school kids.,negative
You are a prominent bar in downtown Champaign. Why are you serving lousy chips out of a bag and bad salsa out of a jar?,negative
"Not a coffee drinker, but I am a computer geek in need of wifi. This place is open late (10pm) and has a soda fountain (score). Fresh cookies and pleasant owners make it above average!",positive
"Very shitty buffet... the fried chicken was an insult to me it had no taste same goes for the mac n cheese,asian food. do yourself a favor and go to the MGM Grand buffet way better.",negative
"Above average for M & S. chain,good seafood,but pricey. Other PGH restaurants that serve good seafood at the same price range that are not chains, so visit them instead.",negative
"Shop fees and other nonsense get added on top of seemingly reasonable prices. For tires, go to Costco. For other repairs, go to Precision Tune or Meineke for same service, better value.",negative
Beef ramen was okay. The soup was kind of bland but the beef was real tender. My wife had the shrimp ramen. She was not a fan. I give it a shot and neither am I.,negative
Watered down frozen margaritas and mediocre food. The one in cabo is great which is why we wanted to go. With all the choices nearby save your pesos.,negative
Friendly service. Famous Bojangles chicken. I always look forward to stopping by here when we have long enough layover in this area. Two more days here means two more times I get to stop by.,positive
"Love the fruits! Great prices as well! Open 24 hours (if I'm not mistaken).\n\nFyi, during the winter time, it turns to a Christmas tree place",positive
Small portions but good. Service was OK..our waitress was not the one actually serving us. Steaks average is about $50 per person but it was good.,positive
Food takes way to long. Decorations okay but not the best. Took 30 minutes to get 1 order of Pad Thai out. Server barely noticed us. All in all service was horrible and I would never come back.,negative
"If you're flying an airline that flies out of terminal 3 like United, you better give yourself an extra 20-30 minutes. The terminal 3 security line is far far far slower than terminal 1.",negative

One of the better tasting mexican fare I have found in the valley. I would definitely go back.,positive
"The overabundance of bars like this are why I moved of Pittsburgh. Tacky sports bar with a overwhelming fratboy brodown vibe. If I could rate this place no stars, I would.",negative
Food isn't too good. Service is terrible. Food was super slow. It took 45 min to just get some pho. They are under staffed and the customers suffer for it.,negative
restaurant is closed and not open for business anymore.,negative
Poor quality with cold food and commercial kitchen quality food. Not worth the money. So many better choices for food while in Las Vegas.,negative

"The only thing that, I liked about this buffet place was the seafood and the prime rib and the rest of the food was pretty good!!!",positive
"Love the sandwiches here, they give them to you nice and warm. I have tried about 3 different flavors and have not been disappointed. Their tomato soup is the best!",positive

"Eh, the food here was just okay. I would definitely prefer to eat somewhere else for the money.\n\nThe service was friendly, and the tater tots were good!",negative
"Very average\nNot worth the money\nPluses: tomato soup was outstanding\nMinus: rest of food average, not quite worth the money\n\nIt's Las Vegas, there are much better places to eat for the money.",negative
Great food and cheap too\nOwner answering the call in spanish was hilarious as well\n\nFinished my very generous portion of teriyaki chicken,positive
"Along with the same inspiring performances I have come to expect from a Cirque show, this show has the added bonus of being both hot and funny. Don't miss it!",positive
"The bagels are great but the service is not. Everyone is very nice, but they often get my order wrong. If you can get past that, the bagels are delicious.",negative
Nice set up. I didn't see anything I could live without though. All the stores are the same you would see at any other outlet shopping center.,negative

This place is closed last year.,negative
Decent Mexican dishes. Certainly more of a fast food quaintly rather than authentic.. Greasy but good if your in rush.,negative

"I don't know of it was because i was hungover and starving, but the burrito and bottle of fanta i got were great.",negative
First time here since becoming Sean Patrick's. An \'Irish\' bar playing country music. Don't expect to get served quickly unless you're at the bar gambling. Won't be back.,negative
The food is ok here. Nothing compared to Japan though. I've had better in Japan. We need more restaurants like this in Vegas. One thing bad is that the food is very very OVERPRICED!,negative
This place is not what it seems. The food wasn't the best and some what pricey. The 'style' of the food is different from what you would think it would be.,negative

"Love my haircut, thank you Vanessa, always love the care you give to me",positive
"I used to rate this 5 stars. It was worth driving across town for. Now, the scoops are much smaller and the flavor has changed. Not worth the money, the calories or the drive!",negative
Yes!! Go here! Order anything and it will be delicious. Guacamole and horchata are highlights!,positive
"Pork shank is incredible, mashed potatoes with sauerkraut and bacon below. Service was mediocre, that's why they fell short of 5 stars...cool restaurant.",positive
Management is rude and worthless...,negative
Sometimes the size of the chicken strips is a bit suspect in the box meals. If you want the most bang for your buck order the sandwich with an extra side of Texas toast.,negative

"This place is permanently closed, what a pity!",positive

All I have to say is NO. Just don't go. It's awful. A two year old could have done a better job. Tip and money hungry.,negative
"One of the biggest waste of money ever! Downtown sucks! Let us not revive it Mayor Goodman. Sometimes, you just have to let go of the past. The Las Vegas Strip did.",negative

Shady place..lost my luggage here..only go at your own risk.,negative

This is a terrible management company. Don't expect your deposit back. They will nickel and dime you until they have all of it. They prey on college students. Shame on them!,negative
The service is great and the environment is nice. The vegan options weren't that great and it was very pricey for what you get.,negative

Went there based on yelp reviews. Had Fritto Misto for appetizer and Linguine Mare Nostrum for main course.\n\nService is attentive; food was fine but not much flavor.,negative
This is the perfect way to cool down during summer. They put fresh fruit in their Popsicles and they are extremely reasonably priced.,positive

Yes I shop here. Find great deals here. Believe it or not. Very nice people. I'm here a lot Will return.,positive

Best to come and leave opposite of the mad crowd!,positive

I came here in the summer and I tried it. They start you off with Miso soup. There's a lot of different sushis there to try. :),positive
Not worth it. Rubbery pancakes. Potatoes taste ... Strange. Only thing that was decent was the prime rib.,negative
"The tots here are awesome. You get a ton and they are generous with the toppings of cheese sauce, bacon, sour cream & chives. The tots were perfectly fried.",positive
Bananas Foster French Toast and Mimosas on the patio...OMG this alone was worth the trip. We will be back!!! The service was great.,positive

You have to be friend of the staff to get a table doesn't matter how long you have been waiting. SVC is non existent,negative

The hotels pretty cool. I mean after going to every casino on the strip its just like the others. The scenery is pretty cool yet nothing great stands out about it.,negative

Buffet dinner selection is limited. The Chinese section is not edible. BBQ pork tastes like jerky. Only thing descent is the dessert selections. Not worth the money.,negative

"Great place to get a cut. The gentlemen here are actual barbers with skill. This is an actual barber shop, not a place for hoodlums to hang out it. Great job guys!",positive
Eh...I am very luke warm about this hotel. \n\nI used to stay here all the time because we used our miles. \n\nNothing really special. A vanilla review for a vanilla hotel.,negative

"The deep fried sushi (any of them) are the best. Don't forget to ask for extra octopus sauce 'cause it will make your meal heavenly! And, it's always better to get the eat all you can.",positive
Thoroughly underwhelming. Fish taco made with fish sticks basically. Gigantic margaritas didn't save the rating but were appreciated.,negative

No sign of the awesome manager that was working before. Now two weeks in a row the same drive through lady has screwed up my order.,negative

The best Asaian store around. Love the selection. Awesome smoked herring for cheap. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been.,positive

Great spot! Spacious tables for homework or newspaper reading. Friendly staff. Turkey with brie is awesome.,positive
The brunch is well worth the money. The food and service were excellent. Will definitely be going back.,positive

Order placer person nice. Everything else sucked. The greasy floor was especially bad. An old woman would have busted a hip on that oil spill. Order wrong. Stuff not available. First and last time.,negative
Their coffee is one of the best places I've been to but they made me wait 30 minutes for mine. They should have given me a heads before I bought it.,negative

"Although is very americanized chinese food, the taste is pretty good for the cheap price. Esp lunch, 5 bucks can get you lots of food.\n \nBetter for take out, not a lot of seating area.",positive
"Great place !!\nNice environment. Good food, good bears and good service.\nHad dinner one night and come back next night!\nCoconut shrimps are so good !!!",positive
Been here twice. 99 cent margaritas are standard and what you'd expect. Food is also standard. Price is right for the food.,negative
"The food was well-made and I do enjoy a great spicy kick, but the curry may have overpowered the dish. I may have to give it another shot but perhaps Laotian food is just not for me.",negative
It was fine. The food was OK but I've certainly had better and fresher Thai food elsewhere. I would not go back.,negative
"Excellent customer service, excellent food, and excellent atmosphere. I would recommend this place to anyone. Loved it!!! Very good prices for what you get.",positive
"A very ocnfusing casino layout, but isn't that their goal? Some pits were very warm while others were very cold. Off the beaten path but worth a visit to see the casino and shops.",negative
This place is the real deal. I tried a local Greek chain. My big fat and Z's smokes them all. Try it and see what good fresh Greek is all about.,positive
Pretty good craft your own then weigh it froyo joint,positive
Got the Thai Curry Chicken...horrible. The chicken was weird...it was very thinly sliced and rubbery??? And def not Thai curry.,negative
"This was a no frills cheap buffet, with surprisingly decent food and quality. You wont find anything special here but it was better than eating in the food court. Prices are pretty low as well.",negative
"Come by a few times and haven't been disappointed. Beer, pretzel and burger.....what more can you ask for.",positive
Excellent food. Great prices. The only place on the west coast with properly prepared bagels. Friendly and polite staff.,positive
I like to check out the after holiday deals. Sometimes you find a winner. pricing isn't any better than the other guys,negative
"Good food, good service. No complaints.",negative
Had to call twice and sit on hold for 10 minutes for them to rudely tell me they don't have the item in stock. I will never visit this location based on that call.,negative
Reserved a non-smoking room and they could not accommodate when I checked in. I will never come back.,negative
"Best tacos in Phoenix! No other taco place in Phoenix comes even close to the great tacos they serve here. The wait is long but well worth it. If you want the best tacos, then this is the spot.",positive
"I ordered the carna asada fries, tastes horrible, & ended up throwing it all away. No discounts for the military. Your better off going to viva el taco, free drink with your order.",negative
